    "(1) constraint: A constraint is a restriction on the possible values of two or more variables.\n",
    "(2) backtracking search: Backtracking search is a kind of DFS. For a certain search tree(search tree is the role of recording path and state judgment), backtracking and DFS, the main difference is that backtracking method is not in the solution proces. The complete tree structure is preserved, while the DFS records the complete search tree.\n",
    "(3) arc consistency: A directed arc from variable A to variable B in a CSP is arc consistent if, for every value in the current domain of A, there is some consistent value of B.\n",
    "(4) backjumping: Backjumping is a way of making backtracking search more efficient, by jumping back more than one level when a dead end is reached. \n",
    "(5) Min-conflicts is a heuristic for use with local search on CSP problems. The heuristic says that, when given a variable to modify, choose the value that conflicts with the fewest number of other variables.\n",
    "(6) cycle cutset: A cycle cutset is set of variables which when removed from the constraint graph make it acyclic (i.e., a tree). When the variables of a cycle cutset are instantiated the remainder of the Csp can be solved in linear time."
